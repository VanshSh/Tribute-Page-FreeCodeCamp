  <article id="tribute-info">Atal Bihari Vajpayee 25 December 1924 â€“ 16 August 2018) was an Indian statesman who
   served
   three terms as the Prime Minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months
   from
   1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior leader of
   the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist volunteer
   organisation. He was the first Indian prime minister not of the Indian National Congress to serve a full term in
   office. He was also noted as a poet and a writer.

   He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the Lok Sabha, the
   lower house, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the Member of Parliament for Lucknow,
   retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health concerns. He was among the founding members of the Bharatiya
   Jana Sangh (BJS), of which he was president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged with several other parties to form
   the
   Janata Party, which won the 1977 general election. In March 1977, Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs
   in the cabinet of Prime Minister Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after.
   Former members of the BJS formed the BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee its first president.

   During his tenure as prime minister, India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. Vajpayee sought to
   improve diplomatic relations with Pakistan, travelling to Lahore by bus to meet with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
   After the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, he sought to restore relations through engagement with President Pervez
   Musharraf, inviting him to India for a summit at Agra.

   The administration of Narendra Modi declared in 2014 that Vajpayee's birthday, 25 December, would be marked as Good
   Governance Day. In 2015, he was conferred India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, by the President of
   India, Pranab Mukherjee. He died on 16 August 2018 of age-related illness.</article>
